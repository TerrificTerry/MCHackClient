# Available setups tested.
The default settings can remain undetected by Vulcan. If you want to adjust the range of KA, the frequecy of sending packets, etc., you can open the GUI in game with right shift.  
Be careful: Your account might get banned for any change made to the settings. BypassingInvWalk will be further developed, but is recommended not to change at this point.
